# Binary Exploitation

## Easy
1. First one was fun. Downloaded a file which showed to be executable. Had to run chmod +x to make it executable, the output was "You'll never find the flag!". Running strings on it yielded the flag :)

## Medium
1. Haven't solved this one, and I can't understand why. The challenge asks us to connect with a network through a port and find a way to get the flag. The server wants us to "call the function at the following memory address: Function: 0x5656c26d"
2. No luck with this one either. We had to download a file that said it was a placeholder flag. Fairly easy technique. The second part of the challenge says to use the same process to get the real flag from the network server through a port. They want me to enter a password I don't have...

Edit: I've made some progress. I ran a wget on the server instead, and was able to download a file - index.html which contained the following: Enter the password: GET / HTTP/ 0 Nope!
Huh.
What also downloaded was an executable file named "server". I ran strings on it and found a section that was interesting:

```
Enter the password: 
Nope!

You didn't really think it would be that easy did you?

Flag.txt not present. Error.

## Hard
1. Again, no luck. Gosh I need to improve my BE skills. Connecting to this server returns an output asking us to call 3 functions at 3 addresses. I don't know how to call functions yet!
