# -sans-bootup-ctf-2023

This repository will track the CTF challenges that are part of the WiCys Security Training Scholarship 2023. These are not CTF write-ups, rather techniques that I use to find flags for different CTF categories. There were 45 challenges in all, out of which I managed to solve 37. This was my first CTF and I studied very hard for it and learned a lot. I made the leaderboard, which is huge for me.
Five of the 45 challenges were Introductory challenges, so they are not included.
