# -wicys-ctf-2023

This repository will track the CTF challenges that are part of the WiCys Security Training Scholarship 2023. These are not CTF write-ups, rather techniques that I use to find flags for different CTF categories. There were 45 challenges in all, out of which I managed to solve 37. This was my first CTF and I studied very hard for it and learned a lot. I made the leaderboard, which is huge for me.
Five of the 45 challenges were Introductory challenges, so techniques used for them are not included. 

Also not included are some of the super easy ones on trivia.

I placed 8th out of more than 1000 participants.
